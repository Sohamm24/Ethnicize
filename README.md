In India, numerous skilled artists, MSMEs, and handicraft makers struggle to reach the right clients due to a lack of visibility and proper matchmaking.This project aims to develop an AI-driven recommendation system that analyzes natural language client prompts to accurately match them with the most suitable artist, MSME
### USP
1.  Natural Language Prompts
2.  Image based matching
### What makes this project unique from E-commerce search Engines 
Traditional e-commerce platforms prioritize mass-produced products, making it difficult for handcrafted and custom artwork to be discovered. Clients looking for unique, handmade, and culturally significant art pieces often face challenges in finding the right artist who matches their style, budget, and customization needs
